`BIGDATA ANALYSIS USING MYSQL AND PYTHON`
<br>
The Bigdata analysis was done by the dataset found online containing the details of Covid-19(didn't double-check that the information was correct) confirmed, recovered and death cases around the world from 01-01-2020 – 25-08-2021 from all the countries.
In this analysis we were interested about the situations from India:
During analysis we took 4 parameters into consideration i.e., what’s the number of death cases recovered cases and confirmed cases <br>
`•	Before Lockdown was announced`<br>
`•	In 2020, after Lockdown was announced`<br>
`•	In 2021, till the data is available`<br>
`•	All total from the first day to data-collection to the last day.`
The data after analysis came out: <br>
Total Death before lockdown is: `56`<br>
Total Death after lockdown in 2020 is: `17171598`<br>
Total Death in 2021 is: `77312076`<br>
Total Death in corona till data collection: `94483674`<br>
Total Confirmed cases before lockdown is: `3391`<br>
Total Confirmed cases after lockdown in 2020 is: `1084280238`<br>
Total Confirmed cases in 2021 is: `5947878573`<br>
Total Confirmed cases till data collection is: `7032158811`<br>
Total Recovered cases before lockdown is: `280`<br>
Total Recovered cases after lockdown is: `951172163`<br>
Total Recovered cases in 2021 is: `3908215694`<br>
Total Recovered cases till data collection is: `4859387857`<br>
	
For the analysis I used these python libraries:
•	Pandas
•	Mysql.connector
•	Sqlalchemy
The total analysis code along with the dataset is uploaded on the GitHub.
